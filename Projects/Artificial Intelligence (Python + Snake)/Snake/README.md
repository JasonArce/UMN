# SnakeAI
We used Visual Studio C++ to create our AI project, a snake that can be controlled by multiple different AI algorithms
We used the SMFL graphics library to render a visual of the snake and game board
We did not download or implement any code from the web



All source code can be found in 
SnakeAI/Snek/Snek.cpp


The executable file can be found in SnakeAI/x64/Release/Snek.exe
Download the whole release folder and run the executable to test the program
